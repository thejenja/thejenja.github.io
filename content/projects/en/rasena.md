# Zhivizna: Harmony of Body and Mind in Your Pocket

In the world of fitness trackers and meditation apps, integrity is often missing. Some pump muscles, others soothe the mind. The project **"Zhivizna"** (Vitality) unites these worlds. It is a comprehensive PWA application that turns self-care from a routine into an exciting game. We created a tool that helps the user become the best version of themselves through physical workouts, mental practices, and cognitive games.

## Technologies Guarding Health

The application is built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. This is a strategic decision: users can install "Zhivizna" on their smartphone home screen directly from the browser, bypassing app stores. It works offline, sends push notifications, and feels like a native app, while being a cross-platform website.

The frontend is implemented on **Vue.js 3** using the **Vite** bundler, which ensures instant interface response. **Supabase** was chosen as the backend—a modern open-source alternative to Firebase. It provides a PostgreSQL database with powerful Row Level Security (RLS), guaranteeing that users' personal health data is securely protected.

## Gamification and Functionality

"Zhivizna" bets on engagement. We don't just give a list of exercises; we create a game environment:

- **Mental Games**: Trainers for memory, attention, and reaction help keep the brain in shape.
- **Physics and Breathing**: Built-in timers for workouts and guides for breathing practices.
- **Achievement System**: For regularity and progress, users receive awards, increase their level, and unlock new content.

The social aspect is also important. Leaderboards and the ability to create interest groups add an element of healthy competition and community support.

## Design and UX

The interface is designed considering color psychology and one-handed usability. A dark theme with soft gradients (using shades of green and purple in the background) reduces eye strain and sets a calm, productive mood. The use of **Lucide Vue** icons adds lightness and clarity to the interface.

## Outcome

"Zhivizna" is proof that web technologies are capable of solving complex tasks to improve quality of life. The project demonstrates a full cycle of modern product development: from idea and PWA architecture to the implementation of a secure backend and attractive UI. It is a digital companion for those who choose mindfulness.
