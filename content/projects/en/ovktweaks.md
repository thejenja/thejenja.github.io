# OVKTweaks: The Art of Small Changes

Sometimes you don't need to redo everything to make it better. It is enough to fix a couple of margins, round the corners, and remove excess noise. **OVKTweaks** is a collection of micro-improvements for the OpenVK interface, born from my perfectionism.

## Project Philosophy

Unlike global themes, OVKTweaks does not change the design radically. It "polishes" it. I noticed many small flaws in the original engine's layout: somewhere text stuck to the edge, somewhere an icon was shifted by a pixel, somewhere an animation was too abrupt.

This project became my testing ground for honing **Pixel Perfect** layout. I used DevTools like a surgeon's scalpel, finding problem areas and fixing them with targeted CSS injections.

## What's Inside?

- **Interface Cleanup**: Hiding ad blocks and rarely used menu items.
- **Typography**: Improving line heights and text readability.
- **Visual Noise**: Reducing contrast of borders and frames, creating a more "airy" interface.
- **Animations**: Adding smooth `transition` to buttons and links, which the original sorely lacked.

OVKTweaks proves that good design is often invisible. The user may not understand _exactly what_ changed, but they will definitely feel that the site has become more pleasant to use.
