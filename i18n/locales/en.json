		"title": "About me",
		"intro": "Sup! If you made it this far, guess I got your attention. I’m Eugene, but online people call me **thejenja** (or just jenja). I’m a web dev who’s in love with **frontend** and all the fun around it.",
		"approach": "My vibe? More like: *think first, then code*. I’m not the type to slap 2GB of frameworks for a single button. Clean code, **hand-crafted layouts**, and **custom UI** — that’s my thing. I get a kick out of turning messy stuff into something simple, functional and actually aesthetic. If you need someone who still writes CSS by hand while others spam Tailwind just to center a div — you found your guy. Not because I’m oldschool, but ‘cause I love knowing how it all ticks under the hood. Every byte matters, and I like having full control.",
		"interests": "Besides digging into **JavaScript**, **Vue**, and **SCSS**, I’m into a ton of other stuff. Music is a big one — from making beats to just vibin’ to playlists. Sometimes I chill in **Minecraft**, building servers (yep, it’s still about architecture and optimization, just a bit more blocky). **AI**? That’s a whole obsession on its own — always testing, breaking, and mixing it into web projects or just messing around. Oh, and video editing is another side quest I hop on to spice things up with visuals.",
		"conclusion": "So yeah, I’m that **CSS nerd** who’s always trying new tricks, not afraid to experiment, and always down to chat about the latest web trends or how a single line of code can flip the whole UI. I’m all about **open-source**, **pet projects**, and making the web not just work, but feel inspiring. If you’re looking for someone who’ll put actual soul into your project, we’ll click.",
